A website to help bring a shared set of books to an event

## History

The College of Heralds have been running a Heraldic Consult Table at [Pennsic War](http://www.pennsicwar.org/). This involves a number of research books that various people have, but the organization as a whole does not.

We used to have a problem that a few critical books never made it, while too many copies of number of commonly owned books did.

Back in 2006 I wrote a simple Ruby app to organize the books.  The last update was in 2009, and then life got busy so it remained unupdated after that point.  It actually worked successfully until 2017 where the site that was hosting it got very slow.  At that point I discovered that I no longer had a local copy of the code and I could not get in running locally as it was too old (running Rails 2).

This is the new version. When it is done it will (a) not be limited to the Pennsic event but can handle any event with books to share and (b) have better usability and be mobile friendly.

##

Current version is Ruby 2.4.2 and Rails 5 with React 16, using a mongodb back end.

If you want to help with the project, let me know.
